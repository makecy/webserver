ana		added advanced config system with location routing and CGI support, 
		custom error pages, method restrictions and autoindex functionality

ana		added POST/DELETE support and file operations, server implements file
		uploads, form processing, file deletation and request routing based on
		URI patterns.

ana		added proper GET/HEAD request handling, added 404/403 error responses,
		static file serving from www/ directory

ana		currently trying to fix generateResponse to map the request URI to a file 
		path using the server's root and index from config.

ana		server now waits for the complete request body. i fixed the function		ana
		handleClientData, now it waits for complete Content-Length and wont
		process until body is complete. It also handles Content-Length: 0
		correctly.

chris	server looks for "\r\n\r\n" or "\n\n" and then just handles the buffer 		chris
			immidiately, instead of waiting for Content-Length amount of bytes
			within the body. we should wait for the complete request body, so 
			we can handle file uploads and CGI later. nginx seems to respond
			immediately too, but it reads request bodies, when actually needed.

chris	more functional config parsing, i think i focus on this for now		 		chris
